# Prediction-of-Flight-Price
In this repository, worked on the ML based prediction of price of the flight based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is the arrival time, what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source, destination and more.

To solve this problem, developed ML model to predict prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities, using which we aim to build a model which predicts the prices of the flights using various input features.
The dataset contains the features, along with the prices of the flights. It contains 10683 records, 10 input features and 1 output column — ‘Price’.  The output ‘Price’ column needs to be predicted in this set. Used Regression techniques here, since the predicted output will be a continuous value.
